			<p>Out of the many streaming services out there, there are four that stand apart as the most used platforms: Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime. While there are other services like Peacock and Paramount+, none of them have the bandwidth to provide MCU movies to your individual screens. Now here are those top four platforms and what Marvel features are on each.</p>

				<h2>Amazon Prime:</h2>

				<h2>Disney+:</h2>
				<p>Disney + is the home for everything Marvel related. The service includes all of Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4 except for Spider-Man: Homecoming, Far From Home, and No Way Home. Disney+ does not have the rights to the Spider-Man movies as it is owned by Sony. It is also the only platform that includes the Marvel TV Shows as well.</p>

			<div class = "card">
				<img src = "images/Hulu.jpeg" alt="Hulu logo" width="200"/>
				<h2>Hulu:</h2>
				<p>Hulu includes a very random list of Marvel content that is constantly changing. Current highlights are Spider-Man: Homecoming + Far From Home, Ant Man & the Wasp, Deadpool: 1 + 2, Black Panther, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Venom.</p>
